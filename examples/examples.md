# Examples

## Description

Each example in this folder consists of a simple RTIC executable to sanity check the workings of various drivers and workings.  The purpose of these examples is to make firmware development based on combining things that are known to work to (ideally) create a product that we know works

## Examples

### Demo

The demo example is nothing fancy.  It sets up a basic RTIC file and spawns a software task that blinks the onboard teensy 4.1 led.

## Guidelines

- Each example should have a basic writeup both in this markdown file and as a doc comment at the top of the example file.
